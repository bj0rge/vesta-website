Hello.
======

I'm Florent, a 22 years-old weirdo from Paris. Currently studying [Computing and Information Systems](http://www.utt.fr/en/education/engineering-degree/informatics-and-information-systems.html) at [Troyes University of Technology](http://www.utt.fr/en/index.html).

I'm also working as a Freelance iOS Developer at [Better Collective](http://www.bettercollective.com).

## Skills

Here are some programming languages I feel comfortable with:

* Objective-C
* JAVA
* C/C++
* HTML
* CSS

## Projects

I've been working on a few projects:

* bettingexpert iOS, official [bettingexpert](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bettingexpert-free-betting/id778618162?mt=8) iOS app.
* TCAT, iOS app to get TCAT bus timetables (RÃ©gion de Troyes, Aube, France).
* [HT1632C-Clock](https://github.com/fsegouin/HT1632C-Clock), LED Clock for Arduino based on wildstray's awesome HT1632C Library.

Most of them are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/fsegouin) account.

## Contact

I bet you already know how to reach me. I case you still don't know (I'm not that good at betting actually), here are a few hints:

* `_nanoF` on Twitter.
* `florent DOT segouin AT gmail DOT com` in case you still want to use these good old emails.
* `Florent Segouin` should be enough to find me on everything else.
